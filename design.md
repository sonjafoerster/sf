				<h3>User-centered Design & Design Thinking</h3>
				<p>My driving force in all design endeavors is to work for the end user. This means to thoroughly understand user needs and the environment of product usage
				to solve problems of the actual user in their actual context of use. I apply frameworks such as design thinking or jobs-to-be-done to achieve this goal of user-centered design.
    			</p>
			</li>
			<li class="icon fa-map-signs">
				<h3>UX Research</h3>
				<p>To thoroughly understand the actual user needs, I am able to apply a wide variety of UX research methods such as field observations, workflow analysis, user journeys, diary studies,
				or usability evaluations. Ideally, a roadmap for all UX research and evaluation activities is layed out upfront and applied in an iterative manner.
    			</p>
			</li>
			<li class="icon fa-code">
				<h3>Interaction & Interface Design</h3>
				<p>Once the user needs are clarified and prioritized, the interface of the product or service is defined. This involves all touchpoints the user will have with the product
				across all modalities. Once the touchpoints are clarified and the interaction is conceptualized, the interface design can be developed and specified for implementation.
    			</p>

				<h3>Usability for Medical Products</h3>
				<p>I'm a UX Researcher, UX Designer, and Human Factors Engineer specialized on medical products. This means I'm very familiar with the regulatory requirements, associated standards such as the IEC 62366. Plus, I can integrate the full UX research and design lifecycle with other processes such as product risk management and requirements / systems engineering to produce compliant documentation of all required use-related activities.
    			</p>
			</li>
			<li class="icon fa-circle-o-notch">
				<h3>UX Design in agile settings</h3>
				<p>I can scale the UX and Human Factors / Usability activities to integrate with agile development methods. Here, I follow a lean UX approach, meaning a transparent and iterative design process to initiate and continuously evolve products and services.
